The DataCite OAI-PMH Provider exposes metadata stored in the DataCite Metadata
Store ([MDS](https://mds.datacite.org)) using the Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting ([OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/)).
OAI-PMH provides a set of services that enables exposure and harvesting of
repository metadata.

The service is open to everyone and is meant to be accessed by OAI-PMH
compliant harvesters or any application that issues OAI-PMH requests.
The service base address is [https://oai.datacite.org/oai](https://oai.datacite.org/oai)
and the service identifier is available [here](https://oai.datacite.org/oai?verb=Identify).

You will find more information about the DataCite OAI-PMH Provider in our
[documentation portal](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-oai-pmh).
